# Matplotlib Plotting Assignment

This repository contains seven foundational plotting exercises I completed as a beginner learning Matplotlib in Python, on our school Intranet projects.

## Overview
I explored different chart types and techniques for visualizing data, including line graphs, scatter plots, log scales, overlaid lines, histograms, subplots, and stacked bars. Each example demonstrates core Matplotlib features like custom colors, axis labels, legends, and layout management.

## Plots

### 1. Line Graph  
- **What**: Plotted \(y = x^3\) for \(x\) from 0 to 10  
- **Why**: Learned basic line plotting, markers, and axis labeling  

### 2. Scatter Plot  
- **What**: Random “Height vs. Weight” data as magenta points  
- **Why**: Practiced `plt.scatter`, custom colors, and point styling  

### 3. Log-Scale Plot  
- **What**: Exponential decay of C-14 on a logarithmic y-axis  
- **Why**: Used `plt.yscale('log')` to linearize exponential decay  

### 4. Two-Line Comparison  
- **What**: Overlaid decay curves for C-14 (red dashed) and Ra-226 (green solid)  
- **Why**: Adde legends, set precise axis limits, and compare two functions  

### 5. Histogram  
- **What**: Student grades in 10-point bins, bars outlined in black  
- **Why**: Create frequency distributions and customize bin edges  

### 6. All-in-One Figure  
- **What**: Combined the first five plots in a 3×2 grid (last plot spans two columns)  
- **Why**: Manage subplots, adjust font sizes (`x-small`), and add a super-title  

### 7. Stacked Bar Chart  
- **What**: Quantities of apples, bananas, oranges, and peaches for three people  
- **Why**: Draw grouped, stacked bars with specific color assignments and y-axis ticks
